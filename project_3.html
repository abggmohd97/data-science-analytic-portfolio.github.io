										<h2>The Scenario</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The next progression of our project, involving an exciting topic, generated our own point of interest. For this time we will develop and create a data investigation, exploration, and analysis on one of my favourite video game series of all time, EA SPORTS FIFA 22. 
										EA SPORTS FIFA is a football simulation video game that has existed for a long time since 1994 and a major gaming series in football video games world, playable in various gaming platform since then. 
										Throughout this video game, every individual criterion involved such as footballers, coaches, clubs, nationality, tournaments, rules, and format is based on the actual football event in the world right now. 
										By developing a detailed and accurate analysis on this topic, we can see clearly obtain and see for ourself how each of the data created various of unique and interesting trends, allowing us to create a new conclusion for that particular understanding </p>

									<p>The Google Data Analytics Certificate program provides a six step data analysis process. This is the process that will be followed here. The six steps are as follows:<br /><br />

										1. <b>Ask</b><br /><br />
										2. <b>Prepare</b><br /><br />
										3. <b>Process</b><br /><br />
										4. <b>Analyze</b><br /><br />

										<h2>Phase 1: Ask</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The objective of this step is to identify the key stakeholders in the project or analysis, clearly define the business task, and ensure the problem in question is fully understood. 
										But since this project are based on our own ideas, there is no specific stakeholder to be handled. So, the steps involves asking questions on how to fully understand our own objectives, which is examining fifa 22 dataset, before beginning the analysis. 
										As this is a case study based on a fictional problems to solve, and the business task is very clearly defined, there is not much to do here.

										<h2>Phase 2: Prepare</h2>
									</header>

									<p>The objective of this step is to prepare data for the analysis. This begins by identifying the data that will be used -
										 is it already available, or will it need to be collected? Once the data is identified and obtained, it needs to be inspected. 
										This is done to ensure understanding of how the data is organized and structured.
										 The data (as well as the data source) must the be profiled to determine credibility - 
										 are there potential bias problems, are there any problems with the data's integrity, 
										 can it be used to effectively address the business task? The final objective of this step is to ensure the data is handled properly, 
										 abiding by any licensing, as well as privacy and security concerns. As to start, below show list of data set need to be downloaded from
										 the website:

									   <figcaption>Figure 2.1: Source of Dataset</figcaption><br />
								   </a>
								   </section>
								   <p>All expected data set that needed in this analysis need to be downloaded properly as intructed. Before downloading the data, make sure to properly do a quick observation, especilly on the name, category, type or topic
									   of the data. This to ensure that, every data we are going to use are properly relatable to our analysis purposes and also of course to avoid creating outlier in our analysis. After downloading all desired data set to our 
									   local storage, make sure to decide where to keep and stored the dataset in a correct manner. By compiling all the dataset into one single location, it's going to make our data easier to be access, and the most important is to
									   avoided time consuming when finding it. To do that, simply create a folder in desired location in our local computer. Below show the example</a>

									<p>The objective of the process is to choose and prepare tools as well as to process the data to make sure it is ready for analysis - 
										checking for errors, cleaning and transforming it. The tool of choice for this analysis is Python through JupyterLab, and the environment is already set up, so the tools are ready. 
										That leaves profiling and processing the data to identify and address any errors or other problems, as well as transforming the data into the necessary 
										format and structure.

								<h4><li> APPLYING PACKAGES & IMPORTING DATA </li></h4><br />
								<ul>

									<p>To start this phase, simply install anaconda into our local machines. Anaconda is an open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science that aims to simplify package management and deployment.
										Then after installation finished, from anaconda starting page, simply choose JupyterLab. JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data which has a very flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. 
										From that we create our first <i>.ipynb</i> file named <i>project1</i>, in the same folder with the dataset we decided to used for this project. All example shown below: 
										
								   </p>
							    	
									<section id="one" class="spotlights" >
										<img src="images/project3_image/p3.0.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
										<figcaption>Figure 3.1: File Created</figcaption><br />
									
									</section>

									<p> 
										Now, to start with data processing, first we need to import all the data set that we want to use in for our analysis. Previously, we already downloaded and stored all important data set 
										from Kaggle into a folder in our local storage, now it's time to upload it all into JupyterLab for furthur observation. In this project there is two dataset going to be use, which, <i>players_22</i> (consist of data for male footballers) and <i>female_players_22</i> (consist of data for female footballers).
										Before importing all expected dataset, make sure that all data file are in .csv format. Below shows all process and Python syntax used to import, then viewing the data:
								   </p>

										<figcaption>Figure 3.2: Importing and Viewing codes dataset</figcaption><br />
									
									</section>

									<p> From image above, to check whether the dataset is uploaded properly, used a syntax by re-typing variable name we just created, which are <i>df1</i> and <i>df2</i> for data viewing.
										Using <i>df1</i> variable, belows shows the example of the command output:
								   </p>

										<figcaption>Figure 3.3: Imported Data Checking</figcaption><br />
									
									</section>

									<p>Before analyzing the data deeper, it is important to perform some profiling to get a better understanding of the data and its quirks as well as to check accuracy and validity. 
										To start with, first, we need to install all related packages or libraries needed for our analysis. By default, Python already installs a set of general packages during installation. 
										As in our case, adding extra packages or library allow us to add more useful function for our analysis. 
										For this project we will used <i>pandas</i> library, a most widely used packages for data science, data analysis and machine learning tasks.
										The example below shows the process: 
										
								   </p>
							    	
									<section id="one" class="spotlights" >
									
										<img src="images/project3_image/p3.4.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
										<figcaption>Figure 3.4: Importing Pandas packages</figcaption><br />
									
									</section>

									
								</ul><br />
									
								<h4><li> DATA INSPECTION </li></h4><br />
								<ul>
									<p> 
										After we have finished with installing all required packages, it's time to inspect all the dataset used for this project. From a package we just installed in our enviroment earlier, there were various of function we can use to analyse the data. As to begin with, 
										we are using <i>head()</i> and <i>tail()</i> function. Image below show an example of the assigning process:
									</p>

									<section id="one" class="spotlights" >
										<img src="images/project3_image/p3.5.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
										<figcaption>Figure 3.5: head() and tail() functions</figcaption><br />
									
									</section>

									<p> 
										<i>head()</i> function is use to return first 5 rows of the dataset by default, while <i>tail()</i> function use to return last 5 rows of the dataset by default. Both two functions <i>head()</i> and <i>tail()</i> are very useful to begin our investigation on the dataset, 
										especially if we want to figure out a very general information like, what kind of data we have here or maybe we want to know the name of column that are used in the dataset itself. As we run the functions, the result below appears:
									</p>

									<section id="one" class="spotlights" >
										<img src="images/project3_image/head().JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />

										<img src="images/project3_image/tail().JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
										<figcaption>Figure 3.7: tail() function output</figcaption><br />
									
									</section>

										<p> 
											Next, instead of manually counting the number of columns and rows using the previous function, We can use the <i>len()</i> with <i>print()</i> function to count it for us. Below shows the process and result:
										</p>
										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >
											<img src="images/project3_image/p3.6.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />

											<figcaption>Figure 3.9: <i>len()</i> with <i>print()</i> function output</figcaption><br />
										
										</section>

										<p> 
											Also, instead of manually finding and examining each of words from <i>head()</i> and <i>tail()</i> functions output to figure out column names, We can use a simple <i>list()</i> function to list all column names for us. 
											Below shows the process and result:
										</p>

										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >
											<img src="images/project3_image/p3.7.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 3.10: <i>list()</i> function</figcaption><br />
										
										</section>

										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >
											<img src="images/project3_image/list().JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 3.11: <i>list()</i> function output</figcaption><br />
										
										</section>

										<p> 
											As for information, 
											the output that you can see in the picture above, since it is displayed horizontally downwards which takes up a lot of spaces in viewing, the original output was cropped and only half of it was shown above.
										</p>

										<!---
										<p> 
											Other than using <i>head()</i> and <i>tail()</i> functions, we can also use <i>describe</i> functions. <i>describe</i> functions in Python programming Language is used for compactly displaying the internal structure of a R object and also capable to display an internal structure of large lists which are nested. 
											It provides one liner output for the basic R rows letting the user know about the object and its constituents.  Below shows example of the process:
										</p>
										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >
											<img src="images/project2_image/p3.5.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 3.11: <i>str()</i> & <i>glimpse()</i> functions</figcaption><br />
										</a>
										</section>

										<p> 
											Compare to <i>head()</i> and <i>tail()</i> functions, <i>str()</i> and <i>glimpse()</i> functions also display a similar structure as those two functions, but with a much simpler, easy-viewing format and informative result, as it also provides each data type used for every column in the dataset. All the output are shown in the image below

									</ul><br />

									<h4><li> TRANSFORMING DATASET COLUMN </li></h4><br />
									<ul>
	
										<p>
											Now, after we finished examining the dataset, we can choose to either keep the original format of the data or transforming and reshaping it into a much more compatible version with the purposes of our analysis. What meant by that was, tranforming is kind a processes that involved much things related to permanent alteration involving adding, renaming, updating, deleting information within the original dataset. 
											In our case here, from the original data for both <i>df1</i> and <i>df2</i> dataset, we will eliminate some of unused column that may unsuitable for our analysis. 
											Using <i>df1</i> as an example, below show codes of the process:
									   </p>
	
										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >
											<img src="images/project3_image/p3.9.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 3.12: Transforming Data Codes</figcaption><br />
										</section>
	
										<p>
											From codes above, we create a new variable named, <i>df_male</i>. Within the <i>.loc</i> function shown above, we assigned every column we want to apply from the original dataset. After, successfully executed the codes, we use <i>list()</i> function as before to return all column information for newly created dataset.
											All the process and output are shown below:
									   </p>
									   <section id="one" class="spotlights" >
											<img src="images/project3_image/p3.10.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />

											<figcaption>Figure 3.14: <i>list()</i> functions output</figcaption><br />
										</section>
	
									</ul><br /> 


									<!---Process NULL---->

								<h4><li> HANDLING NULL VALUES </li></h4><br />
								<ul>

									<p>
										Now, after we finished examining the dataset, we can start our cleaning process by searching for null and missing values. Null values can specified as an empty or a missing data in columns or rows in every dataset. Without properly handle this kind of errors, it would defecting every conclusion we made during this analysis. 
										So by that, make sure to seriously analyze every possibilities within kind of problems. To find null values, we can use <i>isnull()</i> or <i>notnull()</i> function. In term definition, <i>isnull()</i> function used to check if the particular dataset contains any NA value or not. Below show codes of the process:
								   </p>

								    <section id="one" class="spotlights" >
										<img src="images/project3_image/p3.11.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
										<figcaption>Figure 3.15: <i>isnull()</i> & <i>notnull()</i> functions</figcaption><br />
									</section>

									<p>
										All codes above actually having a similar purposes but with an opposite output. On the first line <i>isnull()</i> function are use to creating a condition that intended to find if there is any null values within the dataset, while the second line code that written as <i>notnull()</i> creating condtion that intended to fulfill condition, is there no null values in the dataset. 
										With the sum() functions, its adds all the null values in each column and returns the sum for each column. Using <i>isnull()</i> functions as example, below shows output retrives:
								   </p>
								   <section id="one" class="spotlights" >
										<img src="images/project3_image/isnull()sum().JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
										<figcaption>Figure 3.16: <i>isnull()</i> functions output</figcaption><br />
									</section>

									<p>
										As we can see from above output, there are several null values counted from each columns. From observation, most of the null values counted from the dataset didn't need to be replace by any new correct values. All null values assigned throughout the dataset are much reasonable considering the exact condition of each individual counted. 
										So by that, there is no need for null remover functions and as an alternative, here are list of several functions that we can use to appropriately handle null values if there is any obtained during the future analysis:
										<ul>
											<li><b>df.dropna()</b> <i>#Eliminating rows with missing values completely from the entire data frame</i></li>
											<li><b>df.fillna(values)</b> <i>#Replacing the NA’s in the entire data frame with ‘values’s</i></li>
											
										</ul>
								   </p>
								</ul><br />  

								<h4><li> HANDLING DUPLICATE VALUES </li></h4><br />
								<ul>
									<p>
										After finished exploring all null values in the dataset, let's proceed with finding and removing all the duplicate values. A duplicate value can be describes as one in which all values in at least one row are identical to all of the values in another row.
										Again as a remainder, without properly handle this kind of errors, it could cause a serious problems in every conclusion we made during whole analysis. So by that, make sure to properly analyze every possibilities within this kind of problems. 
										Now, to find the duplicates values in the dataset, we can use these functions:
								   </p>

								   <section id="one" class="spotlights" >
									<img src="images/project3_image/p3.12.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
									<figcaption>Figure 3.17: <i>any(duplicated())</i> & <i>sum(duplicated())</i> functions</figcaption><br />
									</section>

									<p>
										As we can see, these two functions are a type of function that lies within another function.  The <i>duplicated()</i> function we are using here, is a function that determines which elements of a vector or data frame are duplicates of elements with smaller 
										subscripts and returns a logical vector indicating which elements (rows) are duplicates. <i>any()</i> function used to tell if there are ANY of the given search terms in our vector where it returns either TRUE or FALSE values. 
										Since there is no duplicate value found in the dataset, these values return for both functions:
								   </p>
								    <section id="one" class="spotlights" >
										<img src="images/project3_image/dup()any().JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
										<figcaption>Figure 3.18: <i>df.duplicated().any()</i> functions output</figcaption><br />

									<section id="one" class="spotlights" >
										<img src="images/project3_image/dup()sum().JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
										<figcaption>Figure 3.19: <i>df.duplicated().sum()</i> functions output</figcaption><br />
									</section>

									<p>
										For <i>df_male</i> dataset heare, there is no duplicate values found here during the analysis and of course no duplicate remover functions been used too. So by that, here are list of several functions that we can use to appropriately handle duplicate values if there is any obtained during the future analysis:
								   </p>

								   <ul>
									<li><b>df.drop_duplicates()</b> <i>#Remove duplicate and keep first duplicate row</i></li>
									<li><b>df.drop_duplicates(subset=["column1", "column2"], keep=False)</b> <i>#Remove duplicate rows based on specific column</i></li>
									
									</ul>
									<!--

									<figcaption>Figure 3.18: <i>any(duplicated())</i> & <i>sum(duplicated())</i> functions alternated output</figcaption><br />
									</section>

									<p>
										From the output showed, there are three (3) duplicate values found in <i>sleepDay_merged</i> dataset. Now, to remove the duplicate values, we can use distinct() functions. distinct() function from dplyr package is use to remove duplicate rows and return only unique values in a data set. 
										Now, to begin with, first, to make our task easier, we can use forward pipe operator, <i>%>%.</i> A Pipes operator are an extremely useful tool or technique that allow us to express a sequence of multiple operations which can greatly simplify the code and make every operations more intuitive. 
										Below shows the example of whole process:
								   </p>
								   <section id="one" class="spotlights" >
									<img src="images/project2_image/p3.10.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
									<figcaption>Figure 3.19: Pipe operator & <i>distinct()</i> functions</figcaption><br />
									</section>
	
								   <p>
										From the codes above, we create a new variable called cleaned_sleepDay, to stored our newly updated sleepDay_merged dataset. In programming, a Variables can be describe as a containers that used for storing data values. Every new variable we created that applying a data frame, 
										will be stored as a new dataset in R. To check whether our function properly eliminating the duplicate values we wanted to, we can use dim() function, to retrive dataset rows and column information, then compare it to the original dataset we use. Below show example of process:
							  	   </p>

								<h4><li> CLEANING NAMES </li></h4><br />
								<ul>
									<p>
										After finished removing all duplicate values in desired data set, now, let's cleaning the data to create a proper formating. With a proper formating, it allow us to create a better understanding and eliminated unexpected confusion when analysing our dataset. The most basic 
										cleaning we can start with is renaming. Several column in the dataset may have the name that unsuitable to be applied or probably a typo, as to solve that, rename that column with proper naming convention. In our case, applying daily_activity dataset as an example, there is no specific
										errors or typos founded for each column, but it need proper naming convention. To do that, we can use <i>clean_names()</i> functions. <i>clean_names()</i> functions use to cleans names of an object usually a data frame resulting names becoming unique and consist only of the _ character, numbers, and letters.  
										Below show codes example:

										<figcaption>Figure 3.22: <i>colnames()</i> functions</figcaption><br />
									</section>

									<p>
										To view the updated data set, we can use <i>colnames()</i> functions again. Below shows comparison between before and latest output:

								<h4><li> ADDING NEW COLUMN </li></h4><br />
								<ul>

									<p>
										The next things to do is, if needed, we can create a new column with a new additional information into our data set. Creating a new column allow us to add new perpectives within our data and able to help develop new correlation between new data and existing data. 
										From our df_male and df_female dataset, we can add another additional column, gender, providing information on gender information. In the example below, df_male dataset it used. Below shows the simple codes:
									</p>
									<section id="one" class="spotlights" >
										<img src="images/project3_image/p3.13.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
										<figcaption>Figure 3.20: Adding column codes</figcaption><br />
									</section>

									<p>
										From above codes, by using existing df_male data set, generally will overwrite our existing data set throughout the process. The initial codes start with simply assigned our dataset name which in the example, df_male. After that, in the square bracket, inputting our new column name. Then finally, after an equal symbol, we assigned the desired values for entire column. 
										After we executed the codes, we can re-typed the data set name, df_male, to view the entire update on the data set. Below shows the process and output:
									</p>
									<section id="one" class="spotlights" >
										<img src="images/project3_image/newcolumn.jpg" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
										<figcaption>Figure 3.21: Checking on the updated dataset</figcaption><br />
									</section>
									

								</ul><br />

								
								<!--
								<h4><li> DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS </li></h4><br />
								<ul>
									<p>
										Next, we can continue our analysis phase by creating an initial descriptive analysis. Descriptive analysis can helps to describe, show or summarize data points in
										 a constructive way such that patterns might emerge that fulfill every condition. Now, to create a summarization of data, we can use these functions:
										 <ul>
											<li><b>max(df$column_name)</b> <i> # Return the highest values from a particular column in a dataset</i></li>
											<li><b>min(df$column_name)</b> <i> # Return the lowest values from a particular column in a dataset</i></li>
											<li><b>median(df$column_name)</b> <i> # Return the median values from a particular column in a dataset</i></li>
											<li><b>mean(df$column_name)</b> <i> # Return the total average from a particular column in a dataset</i></li>
										</ul>
									</p>

									<p>
										 Now, let's use total_steps column from <i>cleaned_daily_activity</i> dataset for an example. Total steps in our case study is a total values of user walking pattern or steps, distinct by each of user unique id, recorded by a smart device for a duration of one month. 
										 Using above summarisation functions, it help us to analyse an initial calculation and a statistical values, gaining a brief perpectives, involving the average, median, highest and lowest values of the particular topic. 
										 Below show the real application of functions in R and output:

								</ul>
								-->

								<h4><li> CONVERTING DATA TYPE </li></h4><br />
								<ul>
									<p>
										Now, after we finished with adding the dataset column, we can proceed with converting column with an unproper applied data type. To returns a series with the data type for each columns, we can use dtypes property. From the observation, we can clearly see that
										df_male and df_female data set did not appllied with an accurate data type. Below shows the issues:
									 
									</p>

									<section id="one" class="spotlights" >
										<img src="images/project3_image/mfdata.jpg" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
										<figcaption>Figure 3.22: Data type issues</figcaption><br />
									</section>

									<p>											
										From image above, there are two of the output from two different data set, which <i>df_male</i> (in blue) and <i>df_female</i> (in red) with the list of all of their columns and respectively each of  their data type compared side by side. 
										From both outputs, we can clearly see that there are obvious differences between the data types applied for each column. 
										For example, in the <i>nation_jersey_number</i> column, from the <i>df_male</i> dataset, the column here uses <i>float64</i> as its main data type for the entire values, while, for <i>nation_jersey_number</i> from the <i>df_female</i> dataset, it is clearly different when it uses <i>int64</i> as the data type. 
										Problems like this are crucial and need to be fixed and solve, to be handled in the best ways otherwise, it will interfere with our analysis process, especially on data merging for both data sets.
										To fix the issues here, we can convert the data type for <i>df_female</i>, <i>nation_jersey_number</i> column using <i>.astype()</i> functions.
										Below shows the process and result converting the data type:

									</section>
								</ul><br />

								<h4><li> COMBINING DATASET </li></h4><br />
								<ul>

									<p>
										The next things we can do is, we can combined a specific dataset with another dataset we want. Creating a new combined dataset allow us to create a wider perpectives within our data and able to help develop new correlation. 
										To start combining the dataset, first things to do is make sure both dataset we want to join in have some identical points. An identical point can be describe as a column that works as a connector between first data with the second dataset. Those column 
										usually contains an identical values, identical in total amount (by rows) within two dataset we wanted to combined. In our case, we want to combine only two splitted dataset which are df_male and df_female, merge them as one 
										fifa22_combined dataset. Below shows all command: 
									</p>
									<section id="one" class="spotlights" >
										<img src="images/project3_image/p3.15.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
										<figcaption>Figure 3.25: Combining dataset codes</figcaption><br />
									</section>

									<p>
										To combine two different data set, we can use merge(). A merge() can be describe as a method that updates the content of two data set by merging them together, using the specified method. 
										From above codes, we simply assigned new variable name, fifa22_combined, then proceed with dataset name we want to combine together as one with the full-outer format which returns and combining all rows from both data set.
										As for information we can also use join() function as an alternative too to combine the data set too.
										Below shows the output for data combination process:

								</ul><br />


								<h4><li> GENERAL ANALYSIS </li></h4><br />
								<ul>
									<p>
										To begin, start this phase with a quick observation on how many footballers are there in Fifa 22. This is important to ensure that every data is correct and accurate as mentioned by the provider. 
										To start counting, we can use <i>.nunique()</i> function. A <i>.nunique()</i> function in python lets us quickly count the unique values of one or more variables from desired dataframe. 
										Here we are using "cleaned_fifa22_full", our latest combined dataset as an example. Below shows the process and the output:

										<figcaption>Figure 3.28: Codes Output</figcaption><br />
									</section>

									<p>
										Now, by using <i>.shape</i> method, we can also count how many male and female footballer from this dataset too.  Below shows the process and the output for both part:

									</section>

									

								</ul><br />


								<h4><li> EXPORTING DATA </li></h4><br />
								<ul>

									<p>
										Now let's proceed with exporting dataset. Every dataset that already been cleaned and manipulated properly can be considered to be export as a csv file. By exporting the data set to csv files format, we can use those files to proceed with visualization, especially when using an outsource software. Other than that, exporting also cosidered as a precaution steps, if unexpected thing happened during our whole analysis, by saving and storing all important data set into our local storage, 
										surely avoiding us from losing all the data we have cleaned and repeating all process once again. Below shows all codes we used to exported all data:

									</p>
									<section id="one" class="spotlights" >
										<img src="images/project3_image/p3.16.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
										<figcaption>Figure 3.39: Exporting Data Set as CSV</figcaption><br />
									</section>

									<p>
										From codes above, all the data that been exported wil be stored in assigned local path, <i>'C:\Users\asus\Desktop\'</i>. By assigning a specific path and folders on storing the files, we can organized all the data set proper manner and the most important is avoid time-consuming searching for unlocated files when we need it urgently.
									</p>


								</ul><br />

								<p>
									As a conclusion, some of initial steps process from this phases that were shown before are also been repeated for dataset, df_female. Then after successcully combining both dataset, from the observation, 
									there are four major categories that we can start to analyse from the dataset. First is by using the device to track their daily activity, which consists of recording data on the walking steps, distance traveled, active minutes 
									and also how many calories burnt per day. The second type of user used the device to collect and visualize their sleeping pattern. Then, the third type of user intended to use the device to count and monitored their heartbeat. 
									And last but not least, the fourth user used the device to calculate their BMI and also record their physical weight measurement. A specific explaination for mentioned data will be presented in the next phase of the analysis.

										<h2>Phase 4: Analyse</h2>
									</header>
									
									<p>
										In data analysis, analyse is the most important phase. In this step of the process, the data will be analyzed to uncover patterns and trends in our data to make data-driven decisions. 
										To visiualize the data, we can use tableau. Tableau can be described as a software or tools that allowed data analyst to visualize and exploring interesting trends to answers the objectives.
									</p>
							
									<p>
										To start importing the csv file, inside tableau front tab, click <i>'text file'</i>, then choose our desired csv file, which in our case.
										Before proceed with visualizing the dataset, make sure to check all the column of the data and what kind of data type that were applied for each column. 
										This to ensure that there is no missing data during our visualization phase, and also able to secure proper data type espcially for numbers, to ensure it 
										gives accurate calculation and correct graph reading for the data.
									</p>

									<p>
										The main purposes during visualization phase is to explore, obtain some interesting infromation for the data and the most important things is to answer the objectives for our analysis. 
										Every data column in every dataset are comparable to each other, using row (x) and column (y) shelves structure in Tableau. 
										For the whole processes of visualization, our newly combined dataset, cleaned_fifa22_full are used. Below shows list of columns from the dataset:

									</section>
					
									<br />

									<h4><li> GENERAL SUMMARIZATION </li></h4><br />
									
									<ul>
										<h5>> DEMOGRAPHICS</h5>

										<p>
											 To begin our first visualization, using tableau, we can start by summarizing a general demographic from our cleaned_fifa22_full data set. Below shows the output:	
										</p>

										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >										
											<img src="images/project3_image/v1.1G.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 4.2: General Demographic</figcaption><br />										
										</section>

										<p>
											From information above, we able view several calculation on the total values on each of the selected column from our dataset. 
											From above summarization, there are 163 total different footballer nationalities involved, 55 total leagues counted, 701 total football clubs counted, 19630 Footballers including male and female, 54,846,934 000 total player values and 172,987,450 footballer salaries paid from <i>cleaned_fifa22_full dataset</i>.
											From the initial summarization we just created, we gain a very important and crucial information, a general overview on background detail in Fifa 22.
										</p><br />
																												
									</ul>



									<h4><li> FOOTBALLERS </li></h4><br />

									<ul>
										
										<h5>> GENDER</h5>

										<p>
											 Next, let's focus on footballer by gender. To begin, we start by creating visualization on the total amount between Male and Female footballers through pie chart. All created figure are shown below:
											
										</p>

										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >										
											<img src="images/project3_image/v2.1.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 4.3: Footballer Visualization (i)</figcaption><br />										
										</section>

										<p>
											The figure above shows a comparison between male and female on total individual count from the cleaned_fifa22_full data set. From the pie above, we can clearly see there are two colours separating both category, blue represent Male and orange for Female. 
											From the trend reading above, in fifa 22, total amount of Male footballer are drastically higher than Female footballer with 19239 individual counted, 98.01% of total population, while 391 individual counted with 1.99% of total population only for Female footballer.
											From the graph, we can conclude that, the data reading showed, Male footballer are higher in total amount of individual than Female
										</p><br />

										<h5>> FOOTBALLER MOST PREFERABLE FOOT</h5>

										<p>
											Now, let's create another visualization again with pie chart, on the footballer most preferable foot.
											Footballer preferable foot can be determined as a dominance foot that usually each individual used when dribbling or kicking the ball on the field. 
										</p>

										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >										
											<img src="images/project3_image/v2.11.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 4.4: Footballer Visualization (ii)</figcaption><br />										
										</section>

										<p>
											From above data readings, there are two colours separating both categories, orange for Right-footed while blue for Left-footed. 
											From the observation, most of the footballer loves playing with right foot with 14985 of total individual count make up 76.34% from the total population while another 4645 total individual are left-footed with 23.66% from total population. 
										</p><br />


										<h5>> MALE AND FEMALE PYHSICAL DIFFERENCE</h5>

										<p>
											 Then, our next visualization is, we can create a comparison between Male and Female footballer physicality. Below shows bar chart we created:
											
										</p>

										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >										
											<img src="images/project3_image/v2.7.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 4.5: Footballer Visualization (iii)</figcaption><br />										
										</section>

										<p>
											The graph above shows, a comparison in term of physicality involving height, weight, age and their overall, between two human gender in football, Male and Female. 
											From the graph readings, as expected, we can clearly see that Male footballer are better in physicality strength compare to female. The data shows that, Male footballer are slightly higher than female with an average height, 181.30cm while, female are with an average height of 168.69cm only. 
											Then, in term of weight, Male are surely heavier than female, with an average 74.94kg compare to female with an average 60.92kg of weight measured.
											An average age for Male footballer in fifa 22 is younger that female with an average 25 years old of age while female are older with 27 years old average of age. 
											Finally, for the average overall, Female footballer are having a slightly higher ratings with 76.71, while Male with only 65.77 average rating.
											
										</p><br />

										<h5>> CORRELATION BETWEEN AGE WITH OVERALL AND POTENTIAL</h5>

										<p>
											After finished with previous visualization, lets create a new correlation, this time between footballer Age with their Overall and Potential. 
											Player overall is the average of the key player attributes rates within their potential rate calculated based on their position and international reputation which determines their general performance quality and their value in the game.
											Player potential means in Fifa 22 is used to determines how fast their attributes should grow and when they should stop, simply as a player's predicted or peak of their overall rating.
											Created figure are shown below:
										</p>
									
										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >										
											<img src="images/project3_image/v2.8.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 4.6: Footballer Visualization (iv)</figcaption><br />										
										</section>

										<p>
											The above graph showed that there are two trends within two gender categories, created within one frame separated with two different colour, blue and orange. 
											For the first part, the blue colour lines, its representing the overall and potential readings for male footballer throughout their age, 
											while for the second part, the orange colour lines, represent female footballer overall and potential ratings through their age. 
											For both categories overall and potential within male and female footballer, we can clearly see that, for overall trend line reading, it show a slight increases through progreses of the age.
											While, for the other side, for both male and female, footballer potential are slightly opposite with overall, which its showed that the trend lines are deacreasing through footballer age.
										</p><br />

										<h5>> TOP 30 BEST MALE AND FEMALE FOOTBALLER BASED ON OVERALL</h5>

										<p>
											Now, let's continue with another visualization, this time we want to know who is the best footballer in Fifa 22. To distinguish footballer ratings, we can simply used player overall to create comparison between them. 
											Below shows a list of top 40 best male and female footballers in Fifa 22: 
										</p>

										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >										
											<img src="images/project3_image/v2.9.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 4.7: Footballer Visualization (v)</figcaption><br />									
										</section>

										<p>
											Now, let's explain. From the above table, we can see that, it was splited with two catagories, male and female footballer, as to separated the ranking list by their gender. From 40 footballers names listed, 24 of them are male while other 16 are female.
											From the visualization above, the best footballer for male in the game is Lionel Messi having total overall of 93, followed by Robert Lewandowski with 92 overall and Cristiano Ronaldo on third with 91 overall rated. 
											Now, for female footballer, there are three best player sharing the top spot with similar 92 rated overall which start with Lucia Bronze, Vivianne Miedema and then, Wendie Renard.
										</p><br />

										<h5>> THE BEST MALE AND FEMALE FOOTBALLER BY YEAR OF BIRTH</h5>

										<p>
											Now, let's create another visualization on footballer overall but this time, by their generation. 
											Footballer generation are based on their year of birth, which in Fifa 22 there are 27 generation starting fom 1967 to 2004. 
											Below shows the visualization:
										</p>

										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >										
											<img src="images/project3_image/v2.10.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 4.8: Footballer Visualization (vi)</figcaption><br />										
										</section>
										<p>
											From above visualization, there are a list of years that representing every footballer generation in Fifa 22. Then, we also can see, there is shades of colour orange within male and female column which showing, the higher the overall the darker the colour. 
											Then also, there are some null values within female column which that is because there are no data found on specific year for that particular footballer.
											From the data reading, for male, footballer that were born on year 1985, 1987, 1988, 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1998 are having the highest overall, while 1967, 1979, 1980 and 2004 are among the lowest.
											Then for female footballer, highest overall are within 1985, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995 and 1996 while the lowest are 2002 and 2003.

										</p><br />

										<!---
										<h5>> AVERAGE OVERALL BASED ON DATE OF BIRTH</h5>

										<p>
											Then after we finished with previous visualization, let's create another which on the footballer average overall based on their date of birth. 
											Below shows graph for this section: 
										</p>

										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >										
											<img src="images/project3_image/v5.2.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 4.25: Total user involved in <i>cleaned_day_sleep</i></figcaption><br />										
										</section>
										<p>
											Now, from the graph above, we can see that, it is splited with three colours, blue, red and orange. Each of the colour are assigned for each catagories we created previously, blue for active user, red for moderate user and orange for light or least active user. From our initial observation, we can see that active segment are the highest among others, followed by light in second and then moderate the lowest. 
											In conclusion, among 24 total amount of users in this data set, half of them are actively record their the with total population of 50%, followed by lighly-active user with 37.50% of total user and lastly, 12.50 % for moderately-active user.

										<h5>> FOOTBALLER CONTRACT VALIDITY</h5>

										<p>
											Then, after we finished with previous visualization, let's create another to view on the footballer contract validity in Fifa 22. 
											Below shows graph for this section 
										</p>

										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >										
											<img src="images/project3_image/v5.3.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 4.9: Footballer Visualization (vii)</figcaption><br />										
										</section>
										<p>
											Now, let's explain the chart. From the line graph above, we able to evaluate from the trend line that shows the contract validity for each footballer in fifa 22.
											From the trend lines, most of the footballer contract are valid until 2022 with total of 7466 footballer, followed by in 2023 with 4545, in 2024 with 3092 footballers, then in 2021 with 2194 footballers, 1429 footballers in 2025.
											Then among the lowest are involving year 2026 with 435 total footballers counted, 15 footballers in 2027 and only 1 footballer having contract until 2031.

									<h4><li> NATIONS</li></h4><br />

									<ul>
										
										<h5>> HIGHEST AND LOWEST MALE FOOTBALLER NATIONALITIES COUNTS</h5>

										<p>
											Now let's move with a new section focusing on Nation. To start with our first visualization for this section, We can create highest and lowest footballer count by their nationalities. Below shows two seperately created pie chart, one for highest and another for the lowest:
											
										</p>

										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >										
											<img src="images/project3_image/v2.2.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 4.10: Nation Visualization (i(a))</figcaption><br />										
										</section>

										<p>
											The figure above shows, the highest nationalities counted in fifa 22.
											Since there are 163 total nationalities in fifa 22 for male which is a lot to be list one by one, only the top 15 nations are gathered from the dataset for this section.
											Each of the countries or nationalities name shown above are assigned with different colour to make it clear and easy to differentiate from one to another.
											From the data readings, the nation with the highest footballer counted in fifa 22 is England with the total of 1719 footballers played for 171 different football club.
											This followed by Germany ons second with total of 1214 footballers played for 140 clubs, Spanish with 1086 footballers played for 166 clubs, France has 980 total of footballers played for 238 clubs.

											<figcaption>Figure 4.11: Nation Visualization (i(b))</figcaption><br />											
										</section>
										

										<p>
											The figure above shows, the lowest nationalities counted in fifa 22.
											Since there are 163 total nationalities in fifa 22 which is a lot to be list one by one, only the top 15 nations are gathered from the dataset each for the highest and lowest as shown above.
											Each of the countries or nationalities name shown above are assigned with different colour to make it clear and easy to differentiate from one to another.
											From the data readings, all the nationalties listed are sharing the total numbers of footballer counted, which is only 1 which means they equally the same.
											So, following what on the list, 15 lowest counted country in fifa 22 is indonesia, Estonia, Gibraltar, Barbados, Bhutan, Belize, Afghanistan, Korea DPR, Andorra, Ethiopia, Kyrgyzstan, Guam, Eritrea, Bermuda and last but not least Fiji.
											
										
										</p><br />

										
										<h5>> FEMALE FOOTBALLER NATIONALITIES COUNTS</h5>

										<p>
											After finished with the previous nationalities chart for male, then let's create one for female footballer too. Using pie chart below shows our visualization for this section: 
										</p>

										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >										
											<img src="images/project3_image/v2.4.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 4.12: Nation Visualization (ii)</figcaption><br />											
										</section>

										<p>
											The figure above shows, the highest nationalities counted for female in fifa 22.
											For this part, there are only 17 different nationalities squad and zero (0) football clubs included for female footballer in fifa 22.
											Each of the countries or nationalities name shown above are assigned with a different colour to make it clear and easy to differentiate from one to another.
											From the data readings, all the nationalties listed are sharing the total numbers of female footballer counted, 23 total of them which means they equally the same.
											So, following what on the list, the counted nations in fifa 22 for female are England, Germany, Spain, France, Brazil, Netherlands, United States, Sweden, China, Norway, Portugal, Mexico, Belgium, Australia, Canada, Scotland and last but not least, New Zealand.
										</p><br />

										<h5>> STRONGEST NATIONS BASED ON FOOTBALLER OVERALL</h5>

										<p>
											Now, let's find out which of the nations have the best footballer based on their overall. For this part, only the top 30 nationality are listed for analysis, considered as having the best footballer in fifa 22. Below shows created bar graph for visualizaiton: 
										</p>

										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >										
											<img src="images/project3_image/v2.5.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />

											<figcaption>Figure 4.31: Heartrate Trends visualization (2)</figcaption><br />											
										</section>
										-->

										<p>
											From the graph above, we can clearly see that, each of the nationality splited with different colours as to make things clear, easier to differentiate from one nations to another.  
											From the observations, among 30 nationality listed above, Brazil has the best quality footballer in Fifa 22 with an average overall of 71.03 from 920 footballers. 
											This followed by Italy with 69.98 average overall from 338 footballer,

									<h4><li> LEAGUES</li></h4><br />

									<ul>
										
									
										<h5>> TOTAL FOOTBALLERS COUNT FROM EVERY LEAGUES IN FIFA 22</h5>

										<p>
											After finished with the previous section 'Nation', let's proceed with a new one, now focusing on football leagues in Fifa 22. To begin our first visualization, using bar graph, we create the comparison between numbers of footballers count in each of the leagues in this game. The graph created shown below:
											
										</p>

										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >										
											<img src="images/project3_image/v3.1.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 4.14: League Visualization (i)</figcaption><br />										
										</section>
									

										<p>
											The graph above shows us, the information on which leagues has the highest footballer counts.
											Since every football leagues involving footballer clubs, no female footballer involved in the summarization here.
											From the result we got from the data, leagues with the highest footballer count is MLS (Major League Soccer), division 1 leagues in United States with 771 total footballer counted. 
											This followed by Argentina Primera Division (Divison 1) from Argentina in second, English League Championship (Divison 2) from England, English Premier League (Division 1) from England, 
											Spain Primera Division (Division 1) from Spain and many more. 
											Football leagues with the lowest footballer counted in Fifa 22 is Finnish Veikkausliga (Division 1) from Finland with only 25 footballer counted.
											This followed by English National Leagues (Division 5), Hungarian Nemzeti Bajnokság (Division 1) from Hungary, Cypriot First Division from Cyprus, UAE Arabian Guff League from United Arab Emirates(UAE), Ukrainian Premier League from Ukraine and much more.
											This lower values gained from those leagues in Fifa 22 does not imitating the real-world structure which came with some factor of causes in the game. Furthur investigation and conclusion will be made throughout the whole analysis

											
										</p><br />


										<h5>> LEAGUES DIVISION STRUCTURE</h5>

										<p>
											Then, after we finished with previous visualization, let's create another one, which use to visualize leagues structure in Fifa 22. 
											Below shows pie chart for this section:
										</p>

										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >										
											<img src="images/project3_image/v3.4.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 4.15: League Visualization (ii)</figcaption><br />									
										</section>

										<p>
											Now, let's explain the pie chart. 
											From what we saw from figure above, the pie chart was divided into 5 main section, Division 1 to 5 , each one of them represent by their own unique colours. 
											From the data readings, Division 1 leagues created biggest shade among all in the game which involving 46 leagues and 543 football clubs creating 77.47% from the total footballer population. 
											This followed by Division 2 leagues, formed 13.10% from the total population with 5 leagues and 89 football clubs. 
											On third, the Division 3 leagues creating 6.09% from the total population with only 2 leagues and 44 football clubs counted.
											On fourth, its followed by Division 4 leagues which makes 3.20% of the total population with only 1 leagues and 24 football clubs.
											Finally, the Division 5 leagues which is the lowest among all, only created 0.14% from total population with only 1 leagues and 1 football clubs.

											
										</p><br />

										
										<h5>> FOOTBALLERS AND CLUBS COUNTS FROM LEAGUES BASED ON DIVISION LEVEL</h5>

										<p>
											Let's continue with another visualization scopes, this time let's find out how many footballer and clubs count from each leagues from the first division to the lowest division. 
											Below shows all created pie chart for this section:
										</p>

										<p>
											For the first part of this sections, we will focusing on Division 1 only. 
											But since Division 1 has the total amount of 46 unique leagues names which in our case, too much to be fit in one pie chart diagram, 
											from that issues, two seperated chart created, one for the top leagues and another one for the bottom leagues from that division.
											
										</p><br />

										<section id="one" class="spotlights" >										
											<img src="images/project3_image/v3.5.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />

											<img src="images/project3_image/v3.5.2.JPG" alt="" data-position="center center" style="width:100%" />
											<figcaption>Figure 4.17: League Visualization (iii(b))</figcaption><br />										
										</section>

										<p>
											Now, let's explain above diagrams. From the pie chart above, the first pie chart, it represented the top-ranked leagues from division 1 level, while another one represent the bottom-ranked.
											Out of 46 leagues, 15 leagues generated for the first pie chart, while another 10 leagues listed for the second pie chart.
											For the top-ranked pie chart, from the initial observation, the higher the footballers in the leagues, the higher for the chances to get more clubs listed in the leagues too. 
											From the chart, we can clearly see that, Major League Socce has the highest footballer in leagues with the total of 771 footballers involved, and by that it also has the highest total clubs with 27 total clubs.
											This followed by, Argentina Primera Division with 727 total footballers and 26 football clubs, then, English Premier League with total of 652 footballer and 20 football clubs.
											Now move to the second pie chart, leagues with the lowest footballer for division 1 from the game is Finnish Veikkausliga with only 25 footballers and one football clubs, followed by UAE Arabian Gulf Leagues woth 28 footballers and one football clubs.
											From this observation, we can correlated the result we found here with bar graph from figure....  . 
											In conclusion, each of leagues with low amount of footballer and clubs are slightly different compared to the actual real world structure for each of expected leagues which means that, the problems begins with the Fifa 22 game developer that didnt provide and create enough content that should fullfilled expected requirements.
											
											
										</p><br />

										<p>
											
											Now we finished with the first part, let's proceed with the third pie chart. Below shows a pie chart created for Division 2 until 5:
											
										</p><br />

											<figcaption>Figure 4.18: League Visualization (iii(c))</figcaption><br />									
										</section>

										<p>
											From the pie chart above, we can see that, Division 2 leagues, English League Championship has the highest total amount of footballers with total of 717 with 24 football clubs.
											This followed by Division 3 league, English League one, with 626 total footballers and 24 football clubs.
											Among the lowest are Division 5 league, English National League with only 27 footballers and only one football clubs, followed by another Division 2 League, Italian Serie B with 132 footballers and 5 football clubs.
											Sharing similar conclusion as before, each of leagues with low amount of footballer and clubs are slightly different compared to the actual real world structure for each of expected leagues which means that, the problems begins with the Fifa 22 game developer that didnt provide and create enough content that should fullfilled expected requirements.
											
										</p><br />


										<h5>> FOOTBALLERS OVERALL FROM EACH LEAGUES</h5>

										<p>
											For the last part of this 'League' section, we create the last visualization on the average footballer overall in every leagues in fifa 22. For this part, 2 different bar chart created, the first one is for all division 1 leagues and another one is for division 2 until division 5 leagues. Below shows created graphs: 
										</p>

											<figcaption>Figure 4.19: League Visualization (iv(a))</figcaption><br />										
										</section>

										
										<p>
											Now, let's explain the graph we just created. From the first graph, all division 1 leagues are listed from the highest-ranked to the lowest-ranked by footballer average overall each seperated with unique colours. 
											From what we can see from the data trends, Spain Primera Division has the highest quality footballer counted compared to others with an average of 73.47 overall within 20 football clubs. 
											Second place belong to Italian Serie A, having an average of 72.86 footballer overall within 20 clubs, followed by on the third, English Premier Leagues with an average of 72.50 footabller overall also within 20 football clubs.
											Among the lowest from division 1 leagues, are

											<figcaption>Figure 4.20: League Visualization (iv(b))</figcaption><br />									
										</section>

										<p>
											After that, let's continues with the bar graph that shown above. From the graph, all division 2 until 5 leagues are listed together from the highest-ranked to the lowest-ranked by footballer average overall each seperated with unique colours. 
											From what we can see here, Spanish Division 2 leagues, Spain Segunda Division has the highest quality footballer counted among others with an average of 67.25 overall within 22 football clubs. 
											Second place belong to, Italian Division 2, Serie B, which having an average of 66.28 footballer overall within only 5 clubs, followed by on the third, German Division 2 League, German 2.Bundesliga with an average of 66.27 footballer overall also within 18 football clubs.
											Among the lowest, are German division 3 leagues, German 3.Bundesliga with an average of 63.10 footballer overall within 20 football clubs, 
											followed by, English Leagues Two, division 4 league from England with an average overall of 60.33 within 24 football clubs,

										<p>
											Now, after we finished with the previous 'League' section, let's proceed to our final section for this project which focusing on football clubs in Fifa 22. 
											To begin our first visualization, applying bar graph, we create visualization to listed out the most strongest and weekest football clubs in Fifa 22 based on full squad overall. The graph and trends created shown below:
											
										</p>

										<p>
											From the bar graph above, the first graph represented the most strongest football clubs in the game, while another graph represent the most weakest football clubs.
											Out of 701 clubs counted, only 20 clubs listed for the first pie chart, while another 20 clubs generated for the second pie chart.
											Each of football clubs listed in the graph are grouped by their own league and every one of them separated with one unique bar colour.

										</p><br />


										<h5>> TOP AND LOW TIER CLUBS TEAM STRUCTURE</h5>

										<p>
											Now we finished with the previous topic, let's proceed to a new one, this time, let's create a comparison on football club structure between top tier team and low tier team. 
											Below shows two bar graphs, one for top tier, then another one for low-tier clubs: 
										</p>

											<figcaption>Figure 4.24: Clubs Visualization (ii(b))</figcaption><br />											
										</section>

										<p>
											From the diagram and trends above, we can simply know each of teams or clubs listed structure which each consist of two, number of footballers and nationality counted.  
											To begin, we start with top-tier clubs structure. From the graph, there were 15 clubs listed, each one of them are most strongest club in the Fifa 22. 
											From what we can observed, the maximum number of footballer in one team are 33, and only five (5) football clubs has fullfilled the capacity. 
											Most of clubs listed from the graph has at least six (6) with an average 12.73 different nationality within a club.
											Now, move forward with the next graph, which there were 15 clubs listed, each one of them are most weakest club in the Fifa 22.
											As mentioned before, the maximum number of footballer in one team are 33 total players, but for the lower-tier squad, none of the clubs has fullfilled the capacity.
											Most of clubs listed from the graph has at least three (2) with an average 4.53 different nationality within one club.
											In the final conclusion, from our analysis for both graph above, the higher the football clubs ranked, the bigger and competitive the team structure or demographic within it. 
											
										</p><br />

										
										<h5>> MOST VALUABLE FOOTBALL CLUBS</h5>

										<p>
											Now, let's move on and create another visualization, this time let's find out which football clubs is most valuable.
